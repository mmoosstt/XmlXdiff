# Compare two XML files in unordered manner #

XML has been used to transfer hierarchical data. 
In most of those cases, the ordered relation between sibling 
nodes not important - only ancestor relation is important.

The [X-Diff](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~yuanwang/xdiff.html) algorithm 
describes how two XML documents can be effectively compared in an unordered
manner.
